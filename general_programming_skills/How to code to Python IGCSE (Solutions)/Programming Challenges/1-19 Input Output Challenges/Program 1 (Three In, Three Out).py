## Three In, Three Out
## Program 1
## with comments

## Three inputs to store the answers to the questions
## in three variables.

name = str(input("Please enter your name?"))
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
tvProgram = str(input("What is your favourite TV program?"))


## Each output line requires its own print() statement.
## There are therefore five print() statements.
## Some of the lines will display text in inverted commas
## while others display the data stored in our three variables

print (name)
print ("is")
print (age)
print ("years old and likes")
print (tvProgram)
