## Three In, Three Out (formatted)
## Program 3
## with comments

## As with program 1 three inputs are required to store the answers to
## the questions in three different variables.

name = str(input("Please enter your name?"))
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
tvProgram = str(input("What is your favourite TV program?"))


## In this example are only two lines of output.  We therefore require two
## print() statements.  Each print combines text and variables to produce the
## output shown in the challenge.

print (name,age)
print ("Likes watching",tvProgram)
