## Advice Please
## Program 20
## with comments

## The user is asked to input the answer to a question:

advice = str(input("Would you like some advice?"))

## The program now makes a decision.
## If the user enters 'Y' the program should display a messgage.

if advice == "Y":
    print ("Always know where your towel is.")

## If anything else is entered nothing will happen.  In programming
## doing nothing is easy.  You simply don't write any more code.
