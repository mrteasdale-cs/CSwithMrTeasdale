## Lines Cheat
## Program 28
## With Comments

## The user is asked to input a sentence (string):

sentence = str(input("Which sentence would you like copied?"))

## The program then loops 20 times.
## A print statement inside the loop displays the sentence 20 times.

for loop in range(20):
    print (sentence)


## NOTE
## The print statement is indented (moved in from the left)
## This is how python identifies that print statement is
## inside the loop structure and should be repeated.
